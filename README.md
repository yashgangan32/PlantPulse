# Plant Disease Detection Generalization

## Description:
Welcome to the Plant Disease Detection Generalization repository!
Here, we embark on a journey to revolutionize agriculture through the power of deep learning.
Our project is dedicated to creating a robust, accessible, and efficient solution for identifying plant diseases from leaf images. 
With a focus on leveraging state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and transfer learning techniques, 
we aim to empower farmers worldwide with a tool that enables early disease detection, thus contributing to sustainable agriculture and food security.
